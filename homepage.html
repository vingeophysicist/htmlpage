    <h1>How I started learning Python programming language</h1>
    <p>I gained interest in learning Python because I had an interest in web development. </p> 
    <p>   The journey started years ago when I bought a course on Udemy.</p>  
        <p> It was a Python course, but it was focused on using Python and Django to develop dynamic web applications. </p> 
            <p> I took the course along with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and later on, I learned React to boost my frontend skills. </p> 
                <p>   The journey so far has been a wonderful one for me. Python knowledge has given me the knowledge and power to create wonderful web applications that solve human problems</p>

        class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=250, default='default-slug', unique=True)

    options = (
       ("draft", "Draft"),
       ("published", "Published")
    )
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    content = models.TextField()
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=250, unique_for_date="published")
    user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    published = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=options, default="published")
    objects = models.Manager() #default manager
    PostObjects = models.Manager() # custom manager

    <h3>Why the language match my needs</h3>
    <p> The language matches my needs because of its multipurpose nature. I can decide to use it for data analysis or machine without requiring to learn a new language. It's a very good backend language for web development.</p>
